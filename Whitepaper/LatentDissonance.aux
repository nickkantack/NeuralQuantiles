These estimates will be incorrectly placed, and thus the populations between quantiles (blue and green regions) will be unequal. (b) When a new datum arrives, the immediate quantiles to either side are shifted inward by a small amount (e.g. $\sigma / 10$). Further off quantiles are also shifted inwards, although by an amount that scales down linearly with how many quantiles separate it from the datapoint. (c) In the steady state, quantiles will drift so that the populations between quantiles are approximately equal.}}{2}}
